# Luminfield

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

Luminfield is an original bilingual farming-life RPG vertical slice built with
Godot 4.7.1 .NET and C#. It uses no assets, characters, maps, dialogue, music,
or code from Stardew Valley or any other commercial game.

## Vertical slice

The playable loop is:

1. Talk to Mira and receive Starbud seeds.
2. Till at least three farm tiles.
3. Plant and water three Starbuds.
4. Sleep twice so watered crops can grow.
5. Harvest three mature Starbuds.
6. Return to Mira to complete the demo.

After the tutorial, the farm opens into a repeatable economy loop:

- Buy Starbud and Moonroot seeds at the Twilight Market.
- Sell raw crops and more valuable artisan goods for glow coins.
- Load two crops into the Moonwell Infuser, sleep one night, then collect
  Starbud preserve or Moonroot tonic.
- Reinvest the proceeds in more seeds to keep expanding the farm.

The original 48×32 farm now opens through its illuminated southern gate into a
192×128-cell exploration world. Six regions are connected by walkable roads:
the home farm, Whispering Woods, Starfall Meadow, Crystal Vale, Moonwater
Wetlands, and Starfall Ruins. The world is loaded in 32×32-cell chunks; only
the current 3×3 neighborhood remains active, so the camera can travel across
the full map without constructing every region at once.

The top-right minimap reveals chunks as the player enters them, keeps
undiscovered territory hidden, marks discovered landmarks, and stores the
exploration state in the regular save file.

## Tools and backpack

The eight-slot hotbar and the backpack are now separate:

- Slot 1 is always the Hand. Use it to harvest mature crops and inspect
  landmarks.
- The Stardust shovel tills farm soil and mines crystal clusters.
- The Mooncarved machete cuts harvestable trees.
- The Dewglass watering can carries 12 measures of water.
- The water bucket refills the watering can when aimed at a pond, stream, or
  wetland pool.
- The full backpack contains 24 slots. Press `B` or `Tab` to inspect it; the
  first eight slots are the active hotbar.

The target preview identifies the object in front of the player. Mint outlines
mean `E` can perform the shown action, gold explains which tool is required,
and rose indicates an energy, water, seed, or backpack-capacity blocker. Trees,
crystals, water, crops, NPCs, doors, stations, and the bed highlight their
actual object footprint instead of showing an unexplained ground square.

Trees yield Lumenwood and crystal clusters yield Crystal shards. Gathered
nodes disappear, become walkable, and remain gathered after saving. Legacy
saves that contain the old `hoe` item are migrated to the new fixed tool order
without dropping seeds or harvests.

One in-game day lasts about four real minutes. Sleeping in the cottage can end
the day early.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Controller |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | WASD / arrow keys | Left stick / D-pad |
| Use / interact | E / Space | A |
| Hotbar | 1–8 | Shoulder buttons |
| Backpack | B / Tab | Y |
| Pause | Esc | Start |

## Local toolchain

The implementation is pinned to:

- Godot 4.7.1 .NET
- .NET SDK 10.0.302
- Project target framework `net8.0`

For this workspace the tools are installed outside the repository at
`/Users/edy/.codex/tools/luminfield/`.

```bash
export LUMINFIELD_TOOLS=/Users/edy/.codex/tools/luminfield
export DOTNET_ROOT="$LUMINFIELD_TOOLS/dotnet"
export PATH="$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH"

"$DOTNET_ROOT/dotnet" build
"$LUMINFIELD_TOOLS/godot/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot" \
  --path /Users/edy/Desktop/personal/Luminfield --editor
```

## Validation

```bash
dotnet test tests/Luminfield.Tests/Luminfield.Tests.csproj
godot --headless --path . --editor --quit
godot --headless --path . --quit-after 180
./scripts/export_all.sh
```

The save file is written atomically to `user://saves/slot_1.json`. Corrupt saves
are preserved with a `.broken-<timestamp>` suffix.
Glow coins, the active processing job, artisan goods, watering-can water,
gathered world nodes, and the 24-slot backpack are stored in the existing
`schemaVersion: 1` save. Older saves receive safe defaults and tool-ID
migration for the new additive fields. Discovered world chunks are stored as
stable chunk IDs; older saves begin with the home chunk revealed.

Release outputs are created at:

- `builds/macos/Luminfield.zip` — universal ARM64 + x86_64 app, locally
  ad-hoc signed for testing.
- `builds/windows/Luminfield.exe` — Windows x86_64 plus its adjacent .NET data
  directory.
- `builds/linux/Luminfield.x86_64` — Linux x86_64 plus its adjacent .NET data
  directory.

The export script regenerates the macOS entitlement DER during ad-hoc signing,
which is required for local launch on current macOS versions. Developer ID
signing and notarization are intentionally outside this vertical slice.

Key visual acceptance captures are kept under `artifacts/screenshots/`.
